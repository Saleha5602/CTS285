# M2T1 - Webapp #1

## goals:
- to learn basic Flask programming
- to be able to repeat a server config
- maybe to have fun

## lessons learned
bash commands you cannot live without:
- ls <- what's in this directory
- cd <- change directory
- source <- run a script (like activate)

## instructions
initial tutorial: https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/121/
but we're using codespaces instead of PA

install library:

first set up virtualenvironment
- pip install virtualenv
- virtualenv venv
- source venv/bin/activate
now we have our "venv" environment, so we can install things in it.
to turn it off:
- deactivate

start installing requirements:
- pip install flask
- pip freeze > requirements.txt

now we can write our minimal Flask app to test it
TODO: write a Flask app that does something useful!

to start:
- flask --debug --app hello run
